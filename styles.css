 	Hello happy valentines day!!
First of all If I sent this to you it would probably be too late because I'm stuck contemplating if I should send this to you or not. We probably don't know each other much pero I've had my eye on you for a few weeks now. You've been on my mind ever since I saw you and have never left since then. I really really like your cosplays and you. I especially love your rem and zero two cosplay they are sooo cute ❤. I was there sa popx pero wala ko ka papicture saimo :< and I saw u but didn't know it was you. I know we've had little to no interaction, except on social media. That's the part where I wanna know more about you comes in; I want to know what kind of stuff you like, what food you like, or what's your favorite color. I want to know everything about you. Even if you ask me what I like about you I would end up thinking about everything and not be able to give you a specific answer. Also sorry if I followed you on some of your socials I js rlly wanted to interact with you somehow. I really wanted to start talking to you even through social media pero isk how to initiate a conversation . I am also inlove with your elite music taste<33. I am listening to your playlist as I make this.  I keep seeing you at school and I am sorry to say this but I just can't help steal glances here and then. I could write a thousand word essay and I still would have more to say about you and what I feel towards you. I have associated so many love songs to you that play in my head everytime I see you at school. And sorry if wala ko may nahatag this valentines cuz I was stuck procrastinating what would be a good valentines gift for you and ended up not being able to decide. I guess you could call this a love letter from me to you. By the time I finish this love letter I probably have already spent hours perfecting what to say and the content of it. I am probably staying up as I try and make this letter work. But don't worry because every time spent writing this letter will always be worth it to me even though I'm not sure how it will turn out in the end. I'm risking so much by writing and doing this but I'm always willing to risk it all. And I know this is not even close to 7 paragraphs but if I did write 7 paragraphs then I won't have time to send this to you anymore. So I know it would be too much to ask to be my valentine so how about being my friend first?  	Hello happy valentines day!!

Even if you ask me what I like about you I would end up thinking about everything and not be able to give you a specific answer. Also sorry if I followed you on some of your socials I js rlly wanted to interact with you somehow. I really wanted to start talking to you even through social media pero isk how to initiate a conversation . I am also inlove with your elite music taste<33. I am listening to your playlist as I make this.  I keep seeing you at school and I am sorry to say this but I just can't help steal glances here and then. I could write a thousand word essay and I still would have more to say about you and what I feel towards you. I have associated so many love songs to you that play in my head everytime I see you at school. And sorry if wala ko may nahatag this valentines cuz I was stuck procrastinating what would be a good valentines gift for you and ended up not being able to decide. I guess you could call this a love letter from me to you. By the time I finish this love letter I probably have already spent hours perfecting what to say and the content of it. I am probably staying up as I try and make this letter work. But don't worry because every time spent writing this letter will always be worth it to me even though I'm not sure how it will turn out in the end. I'm risking so much by writing and doing this but I'm always willing to risk it all. And I know this is not even close to 7 paragraphs but if I did write 7 paragraphs then I won't have time to send this to you anymore. So I know it would be too much to ask to be my valentine so how about being my friend first?  	Hello happy valentines day!!
First of all If I sent this to you it would probably be too late because I'm stuck contemplating if I should send this to you or not. We probably don't know each other much pero I've had my eye on you for a few weeks now. You've been on my mind ever since I saw you and have never left since then. I really really like your cosplays and you. I especially love your rem and zero two cosplay they are sooo cute ❤.

I am probably staying up as I try and make this letter work. But don't worry because every time spent writing this letter will always be worth it to me even though I'm not sure how it will turn out in the end. I'm risking so much by writing and doing this but I'm always willing to risk it all. And I know this is not even close to 7 paragraphs but if I did write 7 paragraphs then I won't have time to send this to you anymore. So I know it would be too much to ask to be my valentine so how about being my friend first?  	Hello happy valentines day!!
First of all If I sent this to you it would probably be too late because I'm stuck contemplating if I should send this to you or not. We probably don't know each other much pero I've had my eye on you for a few weeks now. You've been on my mind ever since I saw you and have never left since then. I really really like your cosplays and you. I especially love your rem and zero two cosplay they are sooo cute ❤. I was there sa popx pero wala ko ka papicture saimo :< and I saw u but didn't know it was you. I know we've had little to no interaction, except on social media. That's the part where I wanna know more about you comes in; I want to know what kind of stuff you like, what food you like, or what's your favorite color. I want to know everything about you. Even if you ask me what I like about you I would end up thinking about everything and not be able to give you a specific answer. Also sorry if I followed you on some of your socials I js rlly wanted to interact with you somehow. I really wanted to start talking to you even through social media pero isk how to initiate a conversation . I am also inlove with your elite music taste<33. I am listening to your playlist as I make this.  I keep seeing you at school and I am sorry to say this but I just can't help steal glances here and then. I could write a thousand word essay and I still would have more to say about you and what I feel towards you. I have associated so many love songs to you that play in my head everytime I see you at school.

I was there sa popx pero wala ko ka papicture saimo :< and I saw u but didn't know it was you. I know we've had little to no interaction, except on social media. That's the part where I wanna know more about you comes in; I want to know what kind of stuff you like, what food you like, or what's your favorite color. I want to know everything about you. Even if you ask me what I like about you I would end up thinking about everything and not be able to give you a specific answer. Also sorry if I followed you on some of your socials I js rlly wanted to interact with you somehow. I really wanted to start talking to you even through social media pero isk how to initiate a conversation . I am also inlove with your elite music taste<33. I am listening to your playlist as I make this.  I keep seeing you at school and I am sorry to say this but I just can't help steal glances here and then. I could write a thousand word essay and I still would have more to say about you and what I feel towards you. I have associated so many love songs to you that play in my head everytime I see you at school. And sorry if wala ko may nahatag this valentines cuz I was stuck procrastinating what would be a good valentines gift for you and ended up not being able to decide. I guess you could call this a love letter from me to you. By the time I finish this love letter I probably have already spent hours perfecting what to say and the content of it. I am probably staying up as I try and make this letter work. But don't worry because every time spent writing this letter will always be worth it to me even though I'm not sure how it will turn out in the end. I'm risking so much by writing and doing this but I'm always willing to risk it all. And I know this is not even close to 7 paragraphs but if I did write 7 paragraphs then I won't have time to send this to you anymore. So I know it would be too much to ask to be my valentine so how about being my friend first?  	Hello happy valentines day!!
First of all If I sent this to you it would probably be too late because I'm stuck contemplating if I should send this to you or not.

And sorry if wala ko may nahatag this valentines cuz I was stuck procrastinating what would be a good valentines gift for you and ended up not being able to decide. I guess you could call this a love letter from me to you. By the time I finish this love letter I probably have already spent hours perfecting what to say and the content of it. I am probably staying up as I try and make this letter work. But don't worry because every time spent writing this letter will always be worth it to me even though I'm not sure how it will turn out in the end. I'm risking so much by writing and doing this but I'm always willing to risk it all. And I know this is not even close to 7 paragraphs but if I did write 7 paragraphs then I won't have time to send this to you anymore. So I know it would be too much to ask to be my valentine so how about being my friend first?  	Hello happy valentines day!!
First of all If I sent this to you it would probably be too late because I'm stuck contemplating if I should send this to you or not. We probably don't know each other much pero I've had my eye on you for a few weeks now. You've been on my mind ever since I saw you and have never left since then. I really really like your cosplays and you. I especially love your rem and zero two cosplay they are sooo cute ❤. I was there sa popx pero wala ko ka papicture saimo :< and I saw u but didn't know it was you. I know we've had little to no interaction, except on social media. That's the part where I wanna know more about you comes in; I want to know what kind of stuff you like, what food you like, or what's your favorite color. I want to know everything about you. Even if you ask me what I like about you I would end up thinking about everything and not be able to give you a specific answer. Also sorry if I followed you on some of your socials I js rlly wanted to interact with you somehow. I really wanted to start talking to you even through social media pero isk how to initiate a conversation . I am also inlove with your elite music taste<33. I am listening to your playlist as I make this.  I keep seeing you at school and I am sorry to say this but I just can't help steal glances here and then.

I really really like your cosplays and you. I especially love your rem and zero two cosplay they are sooo cute ❤. I was there sa popx pero wala ko ka papicture saimo :< and I saw u but didn't know it was you. I know we've had little to no interaction, except on social media. That's the part where I wanna know more about you comes in; I want to know what kind of stuff you like, what food you like, or what's your favorite color. I want to know everything about you. Even if you ask me what I like about you I would end up thinking about everything and not be able to give you a specific answer. Also sorry if I followed you on some of your socials I js rlly wanted to interact with you somehow. I really wanted to start talking to you even through social media pero isk how to initiate a conversation . I am also inlove with your elite music taste<33. I am listening to your playlist as I make this.  I keep seeing you at school and I am sorry to say this but I just can't help steal glances here and then. I could write a thousand word essay and I still would have more to say about you and what I feel towards you. I have associated so many love songs to you that play in my head everytime I see you at school. And sorry if wala ko may nahatag this valentines cuz I was stuck procrastinating what would be a good valentines gift for you and ended up not being able to decide. I guess you could call this a love letter from me to you. By the time I finish this love letter I probably have already spent hours perfecting what to say and the content of it. I am probably staying up as I try and make this letter work. But don't worry because every time spent writing this letter will always be worth it to me even though I'm not sure how it will turn out in the end. I'm risking so much by writing and doing this but I'm always willing to risk it all. And I know this is not even close to 7 paragraphs but if I did write 7 paragraphs then I won't have time to send this to you anymore. So I know it would be too much to ask to be my valentine so how about being my friend first? Hello happy valentines day!!

I could write a thousand word essay and I still would have more to say about you and what I feel towards you. I have associated so many love songs to you that play in my head everytime I see you at school. And sorry if wala ko may nahatag this valentines cuz I was stuck procrastinating what would be a good valentines gift for you and ended up not being able to decide. I guess you could call this a love letter from me to you. By the time I finish this love letter I probably have already spent hours perfecting what to say and the content of it. I am probably staying up as I try and make this letter work. But don't worry because every time spent writing this letter will always be worth it to me even though I'm not sure how it will turn out in the end. I'm risking so much by writing and doing this but I'm always willing to risk it all. And I know this is not even close to 7 paragraphs but if I did write 7 paragraphs then I won't have time to send this to you anymore. So I know it would be too much to ask to be my valentine so how about being my friend first?  	Hello happy valentines day!!
First of all If I sent this to you it would probably be too late because I'm stuck contemplating if I should send this to you or not. We probably don't know each other much pero I've had my eye on you for a few weeks now. You've been on my mind ever since I saw you and have never left since then. I really really like your cosplays and you. I especially love your rem and zero two cosplay they are sooo cute ❤. I was there sa popx pero wala ko ka papicture saimo :< and I saw u but didn't know it was you. I know we've had little to no interaction, except on social media. That's the part where I wanna know more about you comes in; I want to know what kind of stuff you like, what food you like, or what's your favorite color. I want to know everything about you. Even if you ask me what I like about you I would end up thinking about everything and not be able to give you a specific answer.

First of all If I sent this to you it would probably be too late because I'm stuck contemplating if I should send this to you or not. We probably don't know each other much pero I've had my eye on you for a few weeks now. You've been on my mind ever since I saw you and have never left since then. I really really like your cosplays and you. I especially love your rem and zero two cosplay they are sooo cute ❤. I was there sa popx pero wala ko ka papicture saimo :< and I saw u but didn't know it was you. I know we've had little to no interaction, except on social media. That's the part where I wanna know more about you comes in; I want to know what kind of stuff you like, what food you like, or what's your favorite color. I want to know everything about you. Even if you ask me what I like about you I would end up thinking about everything and not be able to give you a specific answer. Also sorry if I followed you on some of your socials I js rlly wanted to interact with you somehow. I really wanted to start talking to you even through social media pero isk how to initiate a conversation . I am also inlove with your elite music taste<33. I am listening to your playlist as I make this.  I keep seeing you at school and I am sorry to say this but I just can't help steal glances here and then. I could write a thousand word essay and I still would have more to say about you and what I feel towards you. I have associated so many love songs to you that play in my head everytime I see you at school. And sorry if wala ko may nahatag this valentines cuz I was stuck procrastinating what would be a good valentines gift for you and ended up not being able to decide. I guess you could call this a love letter from me to you. By the time I finish this love letter I probably have already spent hours perfecting what to say and the content of it. I am probably staying up as I try and make this letter work. But don't worry because every time spent writing this letter will always be worth it to me even though I'm not sure how it will turn out in the end. I'm risking so much by writing and doing this but I'm always willing to risk it all. And I know this is not even close to 7 paragraphs but if I did write 7 paragraphs then I won't have time to send this to you anymore.

I really wanted to start talking to you even through social media pero isk how to initiate a conversation . I am also inlove with your elite music taste<33. I am listening to your playlist as I make this.  I keep seeing you at school and I am sorry to say this but I just can't help steal glances here and then. I could write a thousand word essay and I still would have more to say about you and what I feel towards you. I have associated so many love songs to you that play in my head everytime I see you at school. And sorry if wala ko may nahatag this valentines cuz I was stuck procrastinating what would be a good valentines gift for you and ended up not being able to decide. I guess you could call this a love letter from me to you. By the time I finish this love letter I probably have already spent hours perfecting what to say and the content of it. I am probably staying up as I try and make this letter work. But don't worry because every time spent writing this letter will always be worth it to me even though I'm not sure how it will turn out in the end. I'm risking so much by writing and doing this but I'm always willing to risk it all. And I know this is not even close to 7 paragraphs but if I did write 7 paragraphs then I won't have time to send this to you anymore. So I know it would be too much to ask to be my valentine so how about being my friend first?  	Hello happy valentines day!!
First of all If I sent this to you it would probably be too late because I'm stuck contemplating if I should send this to you or not. We probably don't know each other much pero I've had my eye on you for a few weeks now. You've been on my mind ever since I saw you and have never left since then. I really really like your cosplays and you. I especially love your rem and zero two cosplay they are sooo cute ❤. I was there sa popx pero wala ko ka papicture saimo :< and I saw u but didn't know it was you. I know we've had little to no interaction, except on social media. That's the part where I wanna know more about you comes in; I want to know what kind of stuff you like, what food you like, or what's your favorite color. I want to know everything about you.

And I know this is not even close to 7 paragraphs but if I did write 7 paragraphs then I won't have time to send this to you anymore. So I know it would be too much to ask to be my valentine so how about being my friend first?  	Hello happy valentines day!!
First of all If I sent this to you it would probably be too late because I'm stuck contemplating if I should send this to you or not. We probably don't know each other much pero I've had my eye on you for a few weeks now. You've been on my mind ever since I saw you and have never left since then. I really really like your cosplays and you. I especially love your rem and zero two cosplay they are sooo cute ❤. I was there sa popx pero wala ko ka papicture saimo :< and I saw u but didn't know it was you. I know we've had little to no interaction, except on social media. That's the part where I wanna know more about you comes in; I want to know what kind of stuff you like, what food you like, or what's your favorite color. I want to know everything about you. Even if you ask me what I like about you I would end up thinking about everything and not be able to give you a specific answer. Also sorry if I followed you on some of your socials I js rlly wanted to interact with you somehow. I really wanted to start talking to you even through social media pero isk how to initiate a conversation . I am also inlove with your elite music taste<33. I am listening to your playlist as I make this.  I keep seeing you at school and I am sorry to say this but I just can't help steal glances here and then. I could write a thousand word essay and I still would have more to say about you and what I feel towards you. I have associated so many love songs to you that play in my head everytime I see you at school. And sorry if wala ko may nahatag this valentines cuz I was stuck procrastinating what would be a good valentines gift for you and ended up not being able to decide. I guess you could call this a love letter from me to you. By the time I finish this love letter I probably have already spent hours perfecting what to say and the content of it. I am probably staying up as I try and make this letter work. But don't worry because every time spent writing this letter will always be worth it to me even though I'm not sure how it will turn out in the end. I'm risking so much by writing and doing this but I'm always willing to risk it all.

Even if you ask me what I like about you I would end up thinking about everything and not be able to give you a specific answer. Also sorry if I followed you on some of your socials I js rlly wanted to interact with you somehow. I really wanted to start talking to you even through social media pero isk how to initiate a conversation . I am also inlove with your elite music taste<33. I am listening to your playlist as I make this.  I keep seeing you at school and I am sorry to say this but I just can't help steal glances here and then. I could write a thousand word essay and I still would have more to say about you and what I feel towards you. I have associated so many love songs to you that play in my head everytime I see you at school. And sorry if wala ko may nahatag this valentines cuz I was stuck procrastinating what would be a good valentines gift for you and ended up not being able to decide. I guess you could call this a love letter from me to you. By the time I finish this love letter I probably have already spent hours perfecting what to say and the content of it. I am probably staying up as I try and make this letter work. But don't worry because every time spent writing this letter will always be worth it to me even though I'm not sure how it will turn out in the end. I'm risking so much by writing and doing this but I'm always willing to risk it all. And I know this is not even close to 7 paragraphs but if I did write 7 paragraphs then I won't have time to send this to you anymore. So I know it would be too much to ask to be my valentine so how about being my friend first?  	Hello happy valentines day!!
First of all If I sent this to you it would probably be too late because I'm stuck contemplating if I should send this to you or not. We probably don't know each other much pero I've had my eye on you for a few weeks now. You've been on my mind ever since I saw you and have never left since then. I really really like your cosplays and you. I especially love your rem and zero two cosplay they are sooo cute ❤.

I am probably staying up as I try and make this letter work. But don't worry because every time spent writing this letter will always be worth it to me even though I'm not sure how it will turn out in the end. I'm risking so much by writing and doing this but I'm always willing to risk it all. And I know this is not even close to 7 paragraphs but if I did write 7 paragraphs then I won't have time to send this to you anymore. So I know it would be too much to ask to be my valentine so how about being my friend first?  	Hello happy valentines day!!
First of all If I sent this to you it would probably be too late because I'm stuck contemplating if I should send this to you or not. We probably don't know each other much pero I've had my eye on you for a few weeks now. You've been on my mind ever since I saw you and have never left since then. I really really like your cosplays and you. I especially love your rem and zero two cosplay they are sooo cute ❤. I was there sa popx pero wala ko ka papicture saimo :< and I saw u but didn't know it was you. I know we've had little to no interaction, except on social media. That's the part where I wanna know more about you comes in; I want to know what kind of stuff you like, what food you like, or what's your favorite color. I want to know everything about you. Even if you ask me what I like about you I would end up thinking about everything and not be able to give you a specific answer. Also sorry if I followed you on some of your socials I js rlly wanted to interact with you somehow. I really wanted to start talking to you even through social media pero isk how to initiate a conversation . I am also inlove with your elite music taste<33. I am listening to your playlist as I make this.  I keep seeing you at school and I am sorry to say this but I just can't help steal glances here and then. I could write a thousand word essay and I still would have more to say about you and what I feel towards you. I have associated so many love songs to you that play in my head everytime I see you at school.

I was there sa popx pero wala ko ka papicture saimo :< and I saw u but didn't know it was you. I know we've had little to no interaction, except on social media. That's the part where I wanna know more about you comes in; I want to know what kind of stuff you like, what food you like, or what's your favorite color. I want to know everything about you. Even if you ask me what I like about you I would end up thinking about everything and not be able to give you a specific answer. Also sorry if I followed you on some of your socials I js rlly wanted to interact with you somehow. I really wanted to start talking to you even through social media pero isk how to initiate a conversation . I am also inlove with your elite music taste<33. I am listening to your playlist as I make this.  I keep seeing you at school and I am sorry to say this but I just can't help steal glances here and then. I could write a thousand word essay and I still would have more to say about you and what I feel towards you. I have associated so many love songs to you that play in my head everytime I see you at school. And sorry if wala ko may nahatag this valentines cuz I was stuck procrastinating what would be a good valentines gift for you and ended up not being able to decide. I guess you could call this a love letter from me to you. By the time I finish this love letter I probably have already spent hours perfecting what to say and the content of it. I am probably staying up as I try and make this letter work. But don't worry because every time spent writing this letter will always be worth it to me even though I'm not sure how it will turn out in the end. I'm risking so much by writing and doing this but I'm always willing to risk it all. And I know this is not even close to 7 paragraphs but if I did write 7 paragraphs then I won't have time to send this to you anymore. So I know it would be too much to ask to be my valentine so how about being my friend first?  	Hello happy valentines day!!
First of all If I sent this to you it would probably be too late because I'm stuck contemplating if I should send this to you or not.
